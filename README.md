# Deep Endoscopic Stereo
A CNN based stereo reconstruction for endoscopic stereo imaging

## Usage

The project has multiple parts to train from different data sources. 

The "predict" scripts will use a trained network "*.npz" to actually predict disparities.

The subproject "creating sparse training data" is currently (without modification) only usable within the (not publicly available) MediAssist Framework
